# VB
- stands for visual basic
- It is an object-oriented language.
- The language is not case sensitive.

## Coding in VB
### Some notes:
- no curly braces
- looks like pseudo code
- it's disgusting
- uses sub for void returning fcns
- no semi colons
- use dim to create variables
- you can pass byval and byref in vb (this language gets grosser and grosser)
- Me in place of this
- note that by explicitly implementing stuff, you can rename your methods, i.e the method name doesn't have to follow the interface nomencleture
